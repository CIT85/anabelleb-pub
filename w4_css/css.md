---
# Box Model
- how elements on a web page are structured and how they interact with each other
- consists of content, padding, border, margin
# Font-Family Fall Back
- if our computer doesnt have the fist choice of font it uses the second choice
- if the font name has no spaces and a dash it doesnt need a quote
# Psuedo Class
- pseudo classes represent the current state of an element
- if a class has more specificity it wont matter if its before or after a class without specificity it will still override it
- a: hover, visited, and active all have the same specificity so they do need to be put into a specific order
- anchor, a:visited, a:hover, a:active is the right order
