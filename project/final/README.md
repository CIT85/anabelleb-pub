# A Beginner's Guide to Indoor Gardening

I am selecting this topic because ChatGPT gave me examples of what I could do using this topic and I thought that it would be an easy topic to turn in to a website. I also really like the color theme ideas it gave to use for this site. Personally I really just wanted to research more about this topic because I want to start my own indoor garden. ChatGPT also said that this topic is visually driven, giving me great opportunities to create responsive layouts.

The prompt I used:
> *"I am taking an html and css class. I am working on my final project and I need to make a website using the coding I've learned so far."*
