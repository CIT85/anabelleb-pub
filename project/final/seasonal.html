            <h2>Seasons Changing</h2>
            <p>While all seasons present challenges for indoor herb gardeners, the two seasons most people tend to
                struggle with the most are Winter and Summer. These extremes—cold, low light in winter and heat, intense
                sunlight in summer—require the most adjustments to ensure your herbs stay healthy.</p>

            <h2>Winter Care</h2>
            <h3>Common Challenges</h3>
            
            <p>Low Light</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Position herbs near south-facing windows, where they’ll get the most light, even in winter.</li>
                <li>If sunlight is insufficient, use grow lights to supplement. Choose LED or fluorescent lights with a full spectrum, and set them to run for 12-16 hours a day.</li>
                <li>Rotate your herbs regularly to ensure they receive even light on all sides and prevent them from becoming leggy (long, spindly growth).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Dry Air</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a humidifier to maintain proper moisture levels in the air, which helps prevent leaf browning and dry spots.
                </li>
                <li>Alternatively, place a tray of water with pebbles underneath your herbs. As the water evaporates, it increases the local humidity around your plants.
                </li>
                <li>Grouping plants together creates a more humid microenvironment, which benefits moisture-loving herbs like basil and parsley.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Slower Growth</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce watering frequency in winter, as herbs are generally growing slower and use less water.</li>
                <li>Ensure your herbs aren’t near cold drafts or heat sources like radiators or vents. Cold drafts can cause stress, while hot air can dry out the plants.</li>
                <li>Reduce or stop fertilizing during winter, as most herbs are in a dormant or slower growth phase. If you do fertilize, use a diluted, balanced fertilizer once every 6-8 weeks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Summer Care</h2>

            <h3>Common Challenges</h3>

            <p>Excessive Heat</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High temperatures can stress plants. Direct sunlight during midday (especially through windows) can be too intense, causing sunburn on delicate leaves.</li>
                <li>Move herbs to a spot with bright, indirect light during the hottest part of the day, or use sheer curtains to diffuse the sunlight.</li>
                <li>If you’re growing herbs outdoors or on a balcony, gradually acclimate your plants to outdoor conditions to avoid shock.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Dry Soil</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Herbs will need more frequent watering in summer, especially as the heat causes the soil to dry out faster.</li>
                <li>Always check the soil before watering. If the top inch is dry, it’s time to water. Water thoroughly, allowing excess water to drain from the bottom of the pot to prevent root rot.</li>
                <li>Water early in the day or in the evening when the temperatures are cooler to avoid evaporation and give your herbs time to absorb moisture before the heat of the day.</li>
                <li>If you’re using air conditioning, the air can be very dry, which can harm herbs like basil, parsley, and cilantro.</li>
                <li>Keep a humidifier running nearby or place a shallow dish of water near your plants to help raise humidity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Pests</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Warm weather attracts pests, so it’s crucial to inspect your plants regularly for signs of infestation.</li>
                <li>Look for tiny bugs, yellowing leaves, or webbing (a sign of spider mites).</li>
                <li>Treat pests with natural remedies like neem oil, insecticidal soap, or homemade garlic sprays to prevent infestations from spreading.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Growth</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Summer is the growing season, so herbs need more nutrients to support healthy growth.</li>
                <li>Fertilize every 4-6 weeks with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. Dilute it to about half strength to avoid overfeeding, which can lead to weak, leggy growth.</li>
                <li>Herbs in larger pots or containers may need more frequent feeding, as the nutrients in the soil can become depleted faster.</li>
            </ul>
