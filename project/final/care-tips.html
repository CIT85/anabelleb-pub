            <h2>Common Plant Problems</h2>
            <p>Indoor gardening can be a rewarding experience, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Whether you're growing herbs on your kitchen windowsill or nurturing houseplants in your living room, common issues like pests, leggy growth, and insufficient light can sometimes hinder plant health. Fortunately, there are simple ways to identify these problems early and take action. In this guide, we'll explore the most frequent indoor plant problems and provide natural, effective solutions. Plus, for those with limited access to natural light, we'll dive into innovative growing methods like hydroponic and aquaponic systems, which offer sustainable alternatives for thriving plants year-round.

                    <summary>How to Spot Pests!</summary>
                    <p>Check the <strong>undersides of leaves</strong> regularly for tiny bugs or eggs.</p>
                    <p>Look for <strong>webbing</strong> or <strong>yellowing</strong> of leaves, which could be a
                        sign of pests.</p>
                    <p>Inspect the <strong>soil surface</strong> for tiny flying bugs or larvae</p>

                <h3>Natural ways to control pests</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Neem Oil:</strong> Dilute neem oil with water and spray it on the affected plants.
                        It's effective for many pests and is non-toxic to humans and pets</li>
                    <li><strong>Insecticidal Soap:</strong> A gentle soap solution can kill soft-bodied pests like
                        aphids and spider mites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diatomaceous Earth:</strong> Sprinkle food-grade diatomaceous earth around the base
                        of plants. It dehydrates pests and is safe for plants and pets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Homemade Peppermint Oil Spray:</strong> Mix peppermint essential oil with water and
                        a small amount of dish soap, then spray it on plants to repel insects like aphids and spider
                        mites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sticky Traps:</strong> Place yellow or blue sticky traps near your herbs to catch
                        flying insects like whiteflies or aphids.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h3>Leggy Growth</h3>
                <p> Leggy growth occurs when a plant grows tall with long, spaced-out stems and small leaves, often a
                    sign of insufficient light. It's common when herbs don’t get enough natural sunlight or when they
                    are too far from a light source.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Provide Adequate Light: Ensure your herbs are getting at least 4-6 hours of indirect sunlight
                        per day. If not, consider supplementing with grow lights.</li>
                    <li>Move Plants Closer to the Light Source: If growing indoors near a window, place plants as close
                        to the light as possible without causing them to burn.</li>
                    <li>Prune Regularly: Pinch back the tops of plants (like basil) to encourage branching and prevent
                        them from growing too tall. This helps promote bushier growth.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Light issues</h3>
                <p>Not all indoor spaces have access to bright, direct sunlight. Some herbs can still grow in low light,
                    but growth will be slower, and the plants may appear leggier</p>

                <h4>Consider Artificial Lights</h4>
                <p> If sunlight is very limited, grow lights can be a great solution to provide the light your herbs
                    need to thrive.
                </p>
                <dl class="lights">
                    <dt>LED Grow Lights</dt>
                    <dd>These are energy-efficient and provide a full spectrum of light, making them ideal for indoor
                        herb growth.</dd>

                    <dt>Flurescent Grow Lights</dt>
                    <dd>These are cheaper but still effective, especially for smaller spaces.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Incandescent Lights</dt>
                    <dd>Not recommended, as they can get too hot and don’t provide the necessary light spectrum for
                        plants.</dd>
                </dl>
                <details class="light-need">
                    <summary>How Much Light is Needed?</summary>
                    <p>Herbs need 12-16 hours of light per day for healthy growth. You can set a timer for your grow
                        lights to simulate the natural light cycle.</p>
                    <p>Place the light about 6-12 inches above the plants, adjusting based on the type of light you’re
                        using.</p>

                <h3>Hydroponic or Aquaponic Systems</h3>
                <p>These soil-free growing methods are excellent for indoor herb gardening, especially in environments
                    with little to no natural light.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Hydroponic Systems</dt>
                    <dd>Herbs grow in a water-based, nutrient-rich solution. Hydroponics can provide faster growth and
                        higher yields, and the plants need grow lights to thrive indoors.
                    </dd>


                    <dt>Aquaponic Systems</dt>
                    <dd>These combine fish tanks with plant growth areas. The waste produced by the fish provides
                        nutrients for the plants, and the plants help filter the water for the fish. Aquaponic systems
                        often require more setup but are highly sustainable.</dd>
