      <section>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Container/Planters: Pots with drainage holes! Proper drainage is crucial to prevent overwatering adn root
            rot.</li>
          <li><a href="#soil-types">Quality Potting Soil:</a> Use a good quality, well-draining potting mix designed for
            indoor plants. Avoid garden soil, it's too heeavy and can compact containers.</li>
          <li>Watering Can: A small watering can with a lon gpsout allows for precise watering. Choose one with gentle
            flow to avoid disturbing the soil.</li>
          <li>Humidity Tray: Many herbs, such as basil, thrive more in a more humid environment. A humidity try can
            increase the moisture around the plants.</li>
          <li>Pruning Shears: A pair of clean sharp scissors or pruning shears are needed to maintain plants and snip
            herbs for cooking.</li>
          <li>Plant Markers: These help keep your plants labelled so there is no mistaking your basil for mint.</li>

        <h3>Soil Types</h3>

        <p>Which Soil Should You Choose?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For Easy, General Use: Go for general potting soil if you're growing a variety of herbs and want something
            versatile and easy.</li>
          <li>For Excellent Drainage: If you're growing herbs that prefer drier conditions, like rosemary or thyme,
            cactus or succulent soil is a great choice.</li>
          <li>For Consistent Moisture: For herbs that need regular moisture but not soggy conditions (like basil and
            parsley), consider coconut coir mixed with perlite.</li>
          <li>For Specialized Herbs: If you're focusing on a specific herb type or growing in a hydroponic system,
            herb-specific potting mix or soil-less mixes may be more beneficial.</li>

        <h3>Pruning and Harvesting</h3>
        <details>
          <summary>How to Prune and Harvest Your Herbs!</summary>
          <p>Regular pruning helps your herbs grow bushier and encourages new growth. For most herbs, it's best to
            harvest leaves by pinching off the tips rather than cutting them with scissors to avoid damaging the plant.
          </p>
          <p>To prune herbs, simply use clean, sharp scissors to snip off the top few inches above a leaf node, remove
            any dead or yellowing leaves, and trim regularly to encourage bushier growth.</p>
          <p>When harvesting, always take no more than one-third of the plant at a time to ensure it continues to grow
            healthily.</p>
